## SpaceX Analysis and Prediction 

### Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

This project aims to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land after launch. SpaceX advertises a launch cost of $62 million, significantly lower than other providers, which charge upwards of $165 million, thanks to the reusability of the Falcon 9's first stage. Accurately predicting the landing outcome helps estimate the overall launch cost and could be critical for competitors looking to challenge SpaceX in the market.

In this capstone, youâ€™ll take on the role of a Data Scientist for a startup aiming to rival SpaceX. You'll work through the entire Data Science lifecycle, including data collection, wrangling, exploratory analysis, visualization, model development, evaluation, and presenting findings to stakeholders. Your goal: develop a model to predict the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings and provide insights that can inform strategic decisions. 

### Objective

To leverage data science techniques and machine learning models to accurately predict the likelihood of a successful first-stage rocket landing, helping to estimate the overall launch cost. Additionally, to perform data exploration for deeper insights and a better understanding of the dataset.
